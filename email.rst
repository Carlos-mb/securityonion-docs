Email Configuration
===================

Some applications rely on having a mail server in the OS itself and other applications have their own mail configuration and so they don't rely on a mail server in the OS itself.

Operating System
----------------

You can install and configure your favorite mail server. Depending on your needs, this could be something simple like ``nullmailer`` or something more complex like ``exim4``.
