Proxmox
=======

Proxmox Virtual Environment is a virtualization platform similar to :ref:`vmware` or :ref:`virtualbox`. You can read more about Proxmox VE at https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve.

If you're going to install Security Onion in Proxmox and sniff live network traffic, you may need to do some additional configuration in Proxmox itself (not the Security Onion VM). For more information, please see https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/discussions/8245.
