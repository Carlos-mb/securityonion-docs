Jupyter Notebook
================

Overview
--------
This section is a brief overview of connecting a Jupyter notebook/server instance to :ref:`elasticsearch` to slice and dice the data as you wish. It will not cover the setup of a Jupyter instance, which has been thoroughly documented (using Docker) at https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

Security Onion Setup
--------------------

**Create Jupyter User**

As a best practice, we'll want to create a dedicated Jupyter notebook user with just read-only access to the data inside of :ref:`elasticsearch`. In :ref:`kibana`, navigate to Stack Management -> Users and create the user with appropriate permissions:

  :target:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144250356-ed1ccfd7-d312-48e1-875d-92c9717b4145.png

**Security Onion Firewall**

In order to allow network-based access to :ref:`elasticsearch`, we'll need to allow the traffic through the host-based firewall by going to :ref:`administration` --> Configuration --> firewall.

  :target: _images/config-item-firewall.png

Once complete, we should be able to reach the :ref:`elasticsearch` instance. We can confirm connectivity using tools like curl, or Powershell's Test-NetConnection.

Jupyter Notebook
----------------

.. note::

  The following steps are heavily inspired by Roberto Rodriguez's Medium post:

  https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/jupyter-notebooks-from-sigma-rules-%EF%B8%8F-to-query-elasticsearch-31a74cc59b99

The Jupyter environment will need to have at least the following Python libraries installed:

- elasticsearch
- elasticsearch_dsl
- pandas

You can install these using the following commands on the Jupyter host, or within the Jupyter Docker container:

::

  pip3 install elasticsearch
  pip3 install elasticsearch_dsl
  pip3 install pandas
  
Once the Python prerequisites are installed, we can start executing commands within our notebook.

We'll start with importing the libraries we just mentioned. In the first cell, we'll paste the following:

::

  from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
  from elasticsearch_dsl import Search
  import pandas as pd
  
Then, we'll press **Shift+ENTER** to execute the command(s) within the cell (can also click to run the cell from the Run menu).

In the next cell, we'll specify the :ref:`elasticsearch` instance address and port (``192.168.6.100:9200``) and the username (``jupyter``) and password (``password``) we created within Security Onion, as well as the index filter we would like to use for searching (``*:so-*``):

::

  es = Elasticsearch(['https://192.168.6.100:9200'],
  ca_certs=False,verify_certs=False, http_auth=('jupyter','password'))
  searchContext = Search(using=es, index='*:so-*', doc_type='doc')

.. note:: 

	We are choosing to use ``verify_certs=False`` here to avoid complications with self-signed certificates during testing. Ideally, we would want to make sure we are performing verification wherever possible.

Again, we'll execute the code within the cell, by pressing **Shift+ENTER**.

We may see a warning like the following due to the fact that we are not performing verification for certificates:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252418-a6ced1a0-ef9e-4c66-b516-dc14facb80a5.png
  :target:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252418-a6ced1a0-ef9e-4c66-b516-dc14facb80a5.png

For convenience during our testing, we can disable the warning in future runs, by pasting the following the next cell and executing it with **Shift+ENTER**:

::

  import urllib3
  urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

In the following cell, we'll paste the following:

::

  s = searchContext.query('query_string', query='event.module:sysmon')

In this example, we are looking for logs that contain a field called ``event.module`` and a value of ``sysmon`` (Sysmon logs). Once more, we'll press **Shift+ENTER** and continue on.

Finally, we'll submit our query in the next cell using the following:

::

  response = s.execute()
  if response.success():
    df = pd.DataFrame((d.to_dict() for d in s.scan()))
  df

The above code simply takes the results and converts them to a Python dict:

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252891-5832070d-1d58-4e28-82f5-ba47081724bf.png
  :target:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252891-5832070d-1d58-4e28-82f5-ba47081724bf.png

We can select a few fields, and modify the column values if we like:

::

  response = s.execute()
  if response.success():
      df = pd.DataFrame(([d['event']['dataset'], d['process']['executable'], d['file']['target']] for d in s))
  df.columns=['Dataset','Executable', 'Target']
  df

Then we end up with something a little bit more targeted (you may need to adjust ``pd.options.display.max_colwidth`` for it to display appropriately) :

.. image:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252941-5821e104-91ce-4fda-a00d-39352e17f9eb.png
  :target:  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16829864/144252941-5821e104-91ce-4fda-a00d-39352e17f9eb.png

Obviously, there is much more we can do with this data other than just running the above example code. Happy hunting!
