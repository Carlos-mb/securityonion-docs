Accounts
========

In Security Onion, there are two main types of accounts:

   - operating system (OS) accounts
   - application accounts used when authenticating to :ref:`soc`

OS accounts are controlled by standard Linux account utilities. SOC accounts are maintained via the :ref:`administration` interface. If for some reason you can't log into SOC, you can use :ref:`so-user` from the command line.
