Re-Indexing
===========

When changing mappings or index settings, we may need to re-index the existing indices to ensure there are no mapping conflicts.

One way to do this by using the following **experimental** example script:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weslambert/securityonion-elastic-misc/master/so-elastic-reindex

Pull down the script to your Security Onion box:

::

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weslambert/securityonion-elastic-misc/master/so-elastic-reindex

Make the script executable:

::

   sudo chmod +x so-elastic-reindex

Re-index all indices matching ``logstash-*``, pulling the appropriate ``refresh_interval`` from the template named ``logstash`` in :ref:`elasticsearch`:

::

   sudo ./so-elastic-reindex -i "logstash-*" -t "logstash"

The script should then progress to re-index the matching indices, and inform you when it has completed.

.. warning::

   Abnormal execution of this script may result in data loss-- there are **NO GUARANTEES** this process will work perfectly for you.
