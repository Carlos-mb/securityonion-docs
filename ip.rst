IP Address
==========

The :ref:`best-practices` section recommends that you avoid changing IP addresses after installation. If for some reason you must do so, you can try the experimental utility ``so-ip-update``.

.. warning::

   ``so-ip-update`` is an experimental utility and only supports standalone machines, not distributed deployments.
