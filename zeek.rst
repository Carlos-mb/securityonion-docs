Zeek
====

Zeek is formerly known as Bro.  From https://www.zeek.org/:

    Zeek is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know. (Zeek is the new name for the long-established Bro system. Note that parts of the system retain the "Bro" name, and it also often appears in the documentation and distributions.)

Zeek logs are sent to :ref:`elasticsearch` for parsing and storage and can then be found in :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`. Here's an example of Zeek conn (connection) logs in :ref:`hunt`:

.. image:: images/hunt.png
  :target: _images/hunt.png
  
Community ID
------------

Security Onion enables Zeek's native support for :ref:`community-id`.

Packet Loss and Capture Loss
----------------------------

Zeek reports both packet loss and capture loss and you can find graphs of these in :ref:`grafana`. If Zeek reports packet loss, then you most likely need to adjust the number of Zeek workers as shown below or filter out traffic using :ref:`bpf`. If Zeek is reporting capture loss but no packet loss, this usually means that the capture loss is happening upstream in the tap or span port itself.

Performance
-----------

Zeek uses :ref:`af-packet` so that you can spin up multiple Zeek workers to handle more traffic.  

To change the number of AF-PACKET workers for :ref:`zeek`:

-  Stop Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-stop

-  Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and change the ``zeek_lbprocs`` variable to the desired number of cores.

-  Start Zeek:

   ::

      sudo so-zeek-start
      
For best performance, Zeek should be pinned to specific CPUs. In most cases, youâ€™ll want to pin sniffing processes to a CPU in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) domain that your sniffing NIC is bound to.  Accessing a CPU in the same NUMA domain is faster than across a NUMA domain.  

.. seealso::

    For more information about determining NUMA domains using ``lscpu`` and ``lstopo``, please see https://github.com/brokenscripts/cpu_pinning.

To pin Zeek workers to specific CPUs:

- Stop sensor processes:

  ::

     sudo so-zeek-stop
       
- Edit ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls`` and add the following under ``sensor:`` 

  ::
  
     zeek_pins:  
       - <cpu_1>  
       - <cpu_2>  
       - <cpu_3> 

- Note: To avoid inconsistent Zeek workers being allocated, ensure ``zeek_lbprocs`` is removed from under ``sensor:`` or is equivalent to the number of cpu cores being pinned. 

- Start sensor processes:

  ::
  
     sudo so-zeek-start

Syslog
------

To forward Zeek logs to an external syslog collector, please see the :ref:`syslog-output` section.

Logs
----

Zeek logs are stored in ``/nsm/zeek/logs``. They are collected by :ref:`filebeat`, parsed by and stored in :ref:`elasticsearch`, and viewable in :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, and :ref:`kibana`.

We configure Zeek to output logs in JSON format. If you need to parse those JSON logs from the command line, you can use :ref:`jq`.

If you want to specify what Zeek logs are ingested, you can use :ref:`so-zeek-logs`.

Zeek monitors your network traffic and creates logs, such as:

conn.log
~~~~~~~~

-  TCP/UDP/ICMP connections

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/conn/main.zeek.html#type-Conn::Info

dns.log
~~~~~~~

-  DNS activity

-  For more information, see:

https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/scripts/base/protocols/dns/main.zeek.html#type-DNS::Info

ftp.log
~~~~~~~

-  FTP activity

-  For more information, see:

| ...and others, which can be researched here:
| https://docs.zeek.org/en/latest/script-reference/log-files.html

As you can see, Zeek log data can provide a wealth of information to the analyst, all easily accessible through :ref:`dashboards`, :ref:`hunt`, or :ref:`kibana`.

Intel
-----

You can add your own intel to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/intel.dat`` on the manager and it will automatically replicate to all forward nodes. If the ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` directory is empty, you can copy the default files (both ``intel.dat`` and ``__load__.zeek``) from ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` as follows:

::

    sudo cp /opt/so/saltstack/default/salt/zeek/policy/intel/* /opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/

Please note that Zeek is very strict about the format of ``intel.dat``. When editing this file, please follow these guidelines:

- no leading spaces or lines
- separate fields with a single literal tab character
- no trailing spaces or lines

The default ``intel.dat`` file follows these guidelines so you can reference it as an example of the proper format.

When finished editing ``intel.dat``, run ``sudo salt $SENSORNAME_$ROLE state.highstate`` to sync ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/intel/`` to ``/opt/so/conf/zeek/policy/intel/``. If you have a distributed deployment with separate forward nodes, it may take up to 15 minutes for intel to sync to the forward nodes.

If you experience an error, or do not notice ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/intel.log`` being generated, try having a look in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/reporter.log`` for clues. You may also want to restart Zeek after making changes by running ``sudo so-zeek-restart``.

Custom Scripts
--------------

Custom scripts can be added to ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/custom/<$custom-module>`` on the manager.  The custom folder is mapped to Zeek through Docker on the minions.  Once the script module is created, the configuration for ``local.zeek`` will need to be updated.  In Security Onion 2, this configuration is abstracted into a :ref:`salt` pillar.  For example, we would copy the following into the ``global.sls`` file, replacing ``$module-name`` on the last line with the actual module name:

::

  zeek:
    local:
      '@load':
        - misc/loaded-scripts
        - tuning/defaults
        - misc/capture-loss
        - misc/stats
        - frameworks/software/vulnerable
        - frameworks/software/version-changes
        - protocols/ftp/software
        - protocols/smtp/software
        - protocols/ssh/software
        - protocols/http/software
        - protocols/dns/detect-external-names
        - protocols/ftp/detect
        - protocols/conn/known-hosts
        - protocols/conn/known-services
        - protocols/ssl/known-certs
        - protocols/ssl/validate-certs
        - protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only
        - protocols/ssh/geo-data
        - protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing
        - protocols/ssh/interesting-hostnames
        - protocols/http/detect-sqli
        - frameworks/files/hash-all-files
        - frameworks/files/detect-MHR
        - policy/frameworks/notice/extend-email/hostnames
        - ja3
        - hassh
        - intel
        - cve-2020-0601
        - securityonion/bpfconf
        - securityonion/communityid
        - securityonion/file-extraction
        - custom/$module-name
      
One the configuration has been updated, Zeek can be restarted with ``sudo so-zeek-restart`` on applicable nodes to pick up the changes.  Finally, ``/nsm/zeek/logs/current/loaded_scripts.log`` can be checked to ensure the new module has been loaded. For example:

::

    grep mynewmodule /nsm/zeek/logs/current/loaded_scripts.log
    
Custom Script Example: log4j
----------------------------

Corelight has developed a Zeek package to detect log4j exploitation attempts and it can be found at https://github.com/corelight/cve-2021-44228. This package contains Zeek scripts which can easily be loaded into your Security Onion deployment.

First, we need to make sure that the ``custom`` directory exists on the manager:

::

	sudo mkdir -p /opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/custom/

Next, download the Zeek package to a temporary location:

::

	git clone https://github.com/corelight/cve-2021-44228.git

Now we need to move the Zeek scripts to the Zeek ``custom`` directory:

::

	sudo mv cve-2021-44228/scripts /opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/custom/cve-2021-44228

Next, we need to configure Zeek to load the new scripts. If ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/global.sls`` does not already contain a ``zeek:`` section, then copy and paste the following at the end of the file (be careful when pasting to respect yaml indentation):

::

  zeek:
    local:
      '@load':
        - misc/loaded-scripts
        - tuning/defaults
        - misc/capture-loss
        - misc/stats
        - frameworks/software/vulnerable
        - frameworks/software/version-changes
        - protocols/ftp/software
        - protocols/smtp/software
        - protocols/ssh/software
        - protocols/http/software
        - protocols/dns/detect-external-names
        - protocols/ftp/detect
        - protocols/conn/known-hosts
        - protocols/conn/known-services
        - protocols/ssl/known-certs
        - protocols/ssl/validate-certs
        - protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only
        - protocols/ssh/geo-data
        - protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing
        - protocols/ssh/interesting-hostnames
        - protocols/http/detect-sqli
        - frameworks/files/hash-all-files
        - frameworks/files/detect-MHR
        - policy/frameworks/notice/extend-email/hostnames
        - ja3
        - hassh
        - intel
        - cve-2020-0601
        - securityonion/bpfconf
        - securityonion/communityid
        - securityonion/file-extraction
        - custom/cve-2021-44228

Within 15 minutes, :ref:`salt` should automatically restart Zeek where necessary. If you don't want to wait, you can manually restart Zeek with the following command. If you have a distributed deployment, you could run this command on each sensor manually or use :ref:`salt` to run the command across all sensors at once:

::

	sudo so-zeek-restart

Modifying base protocol scripts
-------------------------------

If you need to modify base protocol scripts, you can do so as follows. In this example, we are modifying the default ports that Zeek considers for the MySQL analyzer:

::

	const ports = { 11434/tcp, 13306/tcp };

	event zeek_init() &priority=5
		{
		Analyzer::register_for_ports(Analyzer::ANALYZER_MYSQL, ports);
		}
	
Configuration
-------------
You can use :ref:`salt` to manage Zeek's ``local.zeek``, ``node.cfg`` and ``zeekctl.cfg``:
 
``local.zeek``: The allowed options for this file are ``@load``, ``@load-sigs`` and ``redef``. An example of configuring this pillar can be seen below. 
 
``node.cfg``: The pillar items to modify this file are located under the sensor pillar in the minion pillar file. The options that can be customized in the file include: ``interface``, ``lb_procs``, ``pin_cpus``, and ``af_packet_buffer_size``.
 
``zeekctl.cfg``: An example of customizing this can be seen below. The allowed options can be seen in https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/zeek/files/zeekctl.cfg.jinja.

Here is an example of how we would modify ``local.zeek``. We can see the default pillar assignments used for ``local.zeek`` in ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls``. This file should never be modified as it could be updated in the future and any modification made would be overwritten. The global or minion pillar files should be used for making changes as they are stored in ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/``, and that directory isnâ€™t overwritten during a Security Onion code update.

         - LogAscii::json_timestamps = JSON::TS_ISO8601;

In this file, there are two keys under zeek, ``zeekctl`` and ``local``. We will be using ``zeek:local`` for this example since we are modifying the ``zeek.local`` file. We will address ``zeek:zeekctl`` in another example where we modify the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file. 

Under ``zeek:local``, there are three keys: ``@load``, ``@load-sigs``, and ``redef``. In the pillar definition, ``@load`` and ``@load-sigs`` are wrapped in quotes due to the ``@`` character. Under each of the keys, there is a list of  items that will be added to the ``local.zeek`` file with the appropriate directive of either ``@load``, ``@load-sigs`` or ``redef``. In order to modify either of the lists, the entire list must redefined in either the global or minion pillar file.

If we have a node where ``protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing`` is generating a lot of noise and we want to tell Zeek to stop loading that script, we would do the following. Since we just want to turn it off for that specific node, we would open ``/opt/so/saltstack/local/pillar/minions/$SENSORNAME_$ROLE.sls``. At the bottom, we would append the following:

::

   zeek:
     local:
       '@load':
         - misc/loaded-scripts
         - tuning/defaults
         - misc/capture-loss
         - misc/stats
         - frameworks/software/vulnerable
         - frameworks/software/version-changes
         - protocols/ftp/software
         - protocols/smtp/software
         - protocols/ssh/software
         - protocols/http/software
         - protocols/dns/detect-external-names
         - protocols/ftp/detect
         - protocols/conn/known-hosts
         - protocols/conn/known-services
         - protocols/ssl/known-certs
         - protocols/ssl/validate-certs
         - protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only
         - protocols/ssh/geo-data
         - protocols/ssh/interesting-hostnames
         - protocols/http/detect-sqli
         - frameworks/files/hash-all-files
         - frameworks/files/detect-MHR
         - policy/frameworks/notice/extend-email/hostnames
         - ja3
         - hassh
         - intel
         - cve-2020-0601
         - securityonion/bpfconf
         - securityonion/communityid
         - securityonion/file-extraction

We redefined the ``@load`` list in the minion pillar file, but we left out the ```protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing``. This will override the value defined in the ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls`` and the global pillar file if it is defined there, and prevent the script from being added to the ``local.zeek`` file. If we wanted to add a script to be loaded, then we would add out script to the list. Since we arenâ€™t changing ``@load-sigs`` or ``redef``, then we do not need to add them here. Once the file is saved, and the node checks in the with manager, the ``local.zeek`` file will be updated and the ``so-zeek`` docker container will be restarted.

Let's see an example of how we would modify the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file. From the example above, we know that the default pillar values are set for zeek in ``/opt/so/saltstack/default/pillar/zeek/init.sls``. The default pillar values for ``zeekctl.cfg`` are as follows:

::

   zeek:
     zeekctl:
       MailTo: root@localhost
       MailConnectionSummary: 1
       MinDiskSpace: 5
       MailHostUpDown: 1
       LogRotationInterval: 3600
       LogExpireInterval: 0
       StatsLogEnable: 1
       StatsLogExpireInterval: 0
       StatusCmdShowAll: 0
       CrashExpireInterval: 0
       SitePolicyScripts: local.zeek
       LogDir: /nsm/zeek/logs
       SpoolDir: /nsm/zeek/spool
       CfgDir: /opt/zeek/etc
       CompressLogs: 1

For anything not defined here, Zeek will use its own defaults. The options that are allowed to be managed with the pillar can be found at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/salt/zeek/files/zeekctl.cfg.jinja.

In order to add or modify an option in ``zeekctl``, we will need to modify either the ``global`` or ``minion`` pillar file. For example, if we wanted to turn log compression off and change the timeout for Broker communication events to 20 seconds globally, we would add the following to the global pillar file.

::

   zeek:
     zeekctl:
       compresslogs: 0
       commtimeout: 20

Since ``zeek:zeekctl`` is a dictionary with dictionary values, we do not need to redefine the entire pillar here like we did for ``zeek:local`` above. Once the pillar file is saved and the node checks in with the manager, the ``zeekctl.cfg`` file will be updated and the ``so-zeek container`` will be restarted.

Diagnostic Logging
------------------

Zeek diagnostic logs can be found in ``/nsm/zeek/logs/``. Look for files like ``reporter.log``, ``stats.log``, ``stderr.log``, and ``stdout.log``. Depending on what you're looking for, you may also need to look at the :ref:`docker` logs for the container:

::

        sudo docker logs so-zeek

Disabling
---------

Zeek can be disabled by setting ``enabled: false`` in the ``zeek`` :ref:`salt` pillar.

If you just want to disable Zeek on a single sensor, then you can edit that sensor's ``minion.sls`` file. If the file doesn't already have a ``zeek`` section, then add the following to the end of the file:

::

	zeek:
	  enabled: false

If you want to disable Zeek globally across all your sensors, then you could add that entry to your ``global.sls`` file.
