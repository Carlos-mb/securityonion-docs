Sigma
=====

:ref:`elastalert` uses Sigma rules to monitor incoming logs for suspicious or noteworthy activity.

From https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma:

    Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

Managing Sigma Rules
--------------------

You can manage Sigma rules via :ref:`detections`.
