Curator
=======

From https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html#about:

    Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices and snapshots by:

    #. Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the actionable list
    #. Iterate through a list of user-defined filters to progressively remove indices (or snapshots) from this actionable list as needed.
    #. Perform various actions on the items which remain in the actionable list.

.. warning::

        Starting in Security Onion 2.4.40, Curator is no longer included in Security Onion. To learn more about index maintenance, please see the :ref:`elasticsearch` section.
