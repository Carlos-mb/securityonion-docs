Console
=======

When you log into the local bash console, you may see lots of kernel messages. To avoid these kernel messages, you have a couple of options:

- You can use :ref:`ssh` instead of the local bash console.
- You can change the default kernel logging level as described at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/core-api/printk-basics.html.
