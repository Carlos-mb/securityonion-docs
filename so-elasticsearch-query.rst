so-elasticsearch-query
======================

You can use ``so-elasticsearch-query`` to submit a cURL request to the local Security Onion :ref:`elasticsearch` host from the command line.

Usage
-----

::

   so-elasticsearch-query <PATH> [ARGS,...]

Where:

- PATH represents the elastic function being requested.
- ARGS is used to specify additional, optional curl parameters.

Examples
--------

Here's a basic example:

::

   sudo so-elasticsearch-query /
   
Here's a more complicated example that includes piping the output to :ref:`jq`:

::

   sudo so-elasticsearch-query '*:so-*/_search' -d '{"query": {"match_all": {}},"size": 1}' | jq

If you want to delete an old index, you can do that using the ``-XDELETE`` option. For example, to delete the :ref:`zeek` index for 2022/05/07:

::

   sudo so-elasticsearch-query so-zeek-2022.05.07 -XDELETE
