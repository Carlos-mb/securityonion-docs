============

``so-test`` will run ``so-tcpreplay`` to replay some pcap samples to your sniffing interface. Please note that this action could trigger alerts on other enterprise monitoring systems, depending on your network and interface configuration.

.. warning::

  You will need to have Internet access in order to download the pcap samples. Also, if you have a distributed deployment, make sure you run ``so-tcpreplay`` on the manager first to download the necessary Docker image.
