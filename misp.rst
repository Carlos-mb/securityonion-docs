MISP
====

NIDS Rules
----------

| The MISP project provides the ability to export NIDS rules created from events/indicators:
| https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/#get-eventsnids-nids-rules-export

We can leverage this functionality by quickly and easily setting up an automated mechanism to pull NIDS rules from a MISP instance and add them to our local rules for Security Onion. To do so, we just need to follow the simple steps below.

.. warning::

   Please keep in mind we do not officially support this integration, so installation is at your own risk.

Installation
------------

Clone the repo:

::

   git clone https://github.com/weslambert/securityonion-misp

Run the setup script:

::

   sudo securityonion-misp/so-misp-setup

Update rules (if desired):

::

   sudo so-rule-update

Confirm rules in place:

::

   grep -i misp /opt/so/rules/nids/all.rules

You should now be up and running!

MISP rules will be downloaded via cron-job at the interval specified in ``/etc/cron.d/download-misp``.

Elastalert
----------
If we want to send events to TheHive based on the MISP NIDS rules we've pulled into Security Onion, we can implement an Elastalert rule like the following, filtering on the ``alert`` field for NIDS alerts:

:: 

    # misp-nids-hive.yaml
    # Elastalert rule to forward IDS alerts generated by MISP NIDS rules from Security Onion 
    # to a specified TheHive instance.
    #
    es_host: elasticsearch
    es_port: 9200
    name: MISP NIDS Rule Match
    type: frequency
    index: "*:logstash-ids*"
    num_events: 1
    timeframe:
         minutes: 1
    filter:
     - query:
        query_string:
          query: "alert: MISP"

    alert:
    - "hivealerter"

    hive_connection:
        hive_host:  http(s)://YOUR_HIVE_INSTANCE:PORT # Add port if necessary
        hive_apikey: APIKEY
    
    hive_proxies:
      http: ''
      https: ''
    
    hive_alert_config:
        title: '{match[alert]}'
        type: 'external'
        source: 'SecurityOnion'
        description: '{match[message]}'
        severity: 2
        tags: ['elastalert, SecurityOnion, MISP, NIDS']
        tlp: 3
        status: 'New'
        follow: True

    hive_observable_data_mapping:
        - ip: '{match[source_ip]}'
        - ip: '{match[destination_ip]}'
        - other: '{match[interface]}'
        - other: '{match[sid]}'

Simply fill in the pertinent TheHive instance connection details above, and place this rule in ``/etc/elastalert/rules`` as ``misp-nids-hive.yaml``.

As a result, you will receive alerts in TheHive for any matching events in the ``logstash-ids-*`` index.  The following observables will be generated for the alert:

- Source/Destination IP from alert
- Sensor interface from IDS alert
- Signature ID (sid) from alert
