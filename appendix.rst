Appendix
========

This appendix covers the process of upgrading from Security Onion 2.3 to 2.4.

.. warning::

   Security Onion 2.4 is a MAJOR architectural change, so please note the following:

   - Security Onion 2 has higher hardware requirements, so you should check that your hardware meets those requirements. 
   - We do not provide any guarantees that the upgrade process will work! If the upgrade fails, be prepared to perform a fresh installation of Security Onion 2.4.
 
For the reasons listed above, we recommend that most users procure new hardware and perform a fresh installation of Security Onion 2.4.

.. tip::

   If you're planning to purchase new hardware, please consider official Security Onion appliances from Security Onion Solutions (https://securityonionsolutions.com). Our custom appliances have already been designed for certain roles and traffic levels and have Security Onion 2.4 pre-installed. Purchasing from Security Onion Solutions will save you time and effort **and** help to support development of Security Onion as a free and open platform!

If you have reviewed all of the warnings above and still want to attempt an in-place upgrade, you should be able to do the following.

.. warning::

   Please ensure that you have local access to the machine being upgraded via console, DRAC, IPMI, etc.  Failure to do so could result in an unsuccessful upgrade, requiring a clean installation of Security Onion 2.4.
